# DataCamp-Projects-Filter
Identifies DataCamp "Projects" where you have completed the prerequisite courses and have not completed the project yet.

The lists "completed_courses" and "completed_projects" must be manually updated by the user.  Using login credentials to generate these lists is a future task.
